# Causal information-seeking strategies change across childhood and adolescence

Task, analysis code, and data for: Nussenbaum, K*, Cohen, A.O.*, Davis, Z.J., Halpern, D., Gureckis, T.M., & Hartley, C.A. (In Press). [Causal information-seeking strategies change across childhood and adolescence.](https://psyarxiv.com/qukac/) Cognitive Science.

## Running the task:

The task described in the manuscript is an adapted version of the task used in Coenen, Rehder, & Gureckis (2015).

This version can be run through Psychtoolbox-3 in Matlab 2016 or 2017. (It might be compatible with other Matlab versions, but they have not been explicitly tested.)

To run the task, run chipSetup.m and enter a subject ID number when prompted. Use the space bar to progress through the instructions. The actual task uses the mouse.

## Running the analysis scripts:
The file chipTask_mainAnalysisScript.R can be used to reproduce the analyses described in the paper.
